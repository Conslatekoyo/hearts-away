She went off to sleep<br>
My love went off to sleep<br>
Only this time, she won't be<br>
 
smiling down at me when I wake<br>
I think she finally gave up<br>

Or the world made it it's mission<br>

To rip my tender heart to shreds<span id="dots">...</span>

She was finally laid to rest<br>
My love was finally laid to rest<br>
And she took with her all the happiness I knew<br>
All the love I ever felt<br>
She did however leave the pain and suffering<br>
The world let me know that it was a token,<br>
A token of what we shared<br>

I wanted to wish my love  eternal peace<br>
I wanted to be the last to throw down a rose<br>
I wanted to go back home and believe,<br>
she was dancing with the angels<br>
But my demons kept reminding me that no peace exists<br>
So instead I sent off my Angels to keep her company<br>
She needed them more<br>

    <b>Prisoners of Love</b> 
    Love.....<br>
    Such a mysterious phenomenon<br>
    Love is many things<br>
    Love does many things<br>
    Love heals<br>
    Love hurts<br>
    Love destroys

    Love is a sanctuary for the broken<br>
    Love gives life to our memories<br>
    Love is the reason we want to live<br>
    It's also the reason some  itch for death<br>
    Yet without it,we are nothing<br>
    We don't choose who to love,<br>
    When to start loving or when to stop<br>
    Some say that's the beauty of love <br>
    and just like every beautiful thing,,,<br>
    it too has its ugly side <br>
    See...love is the master that beckons<br>
     and like hopeless slaves we follow blindly<br>
    Love is a prison we've created for ourselves <br>
    and  like devout worshippers, we've pledged our allegiance<br>
    So let's make a toast,<br>
    To the bleak abyss we've brought upon ourselves<br>
    Cheers  to the false notion  we call heaven<br>
    Here's to us, To the prisoners of loveðŸ¥‚...<br>

My mind has been holding me hostage<br>
And demands for no ransom<br>

My heart has been estranged from my body<br>
For a couple of months now<br>
And the very thing that gives me life has become the bane of my existence<br>
Sentenced me to death in a prison I created<br>

So....yeah<br>
I'm sorry, I tried<br>
But the counting did more harm than good<br>
So I switched to  the pain<br>
It helped take the edge off my misery<br>

I'm sorry...<br>
I'm sorry I couldn't talk<br>
Because there is a war that's been going on in my mind<br>
And it's been drenching the life out of me<br>

I'm sorry...<br>
I'm sorry I couldn't see you<br>
I couldn't bring myself to be at home at your place<br>
Not when I'm a stranger to myself, in my own world<br>

I'm sorry<br>
I'm sorry because the realization of killing my mind is finally sinking in<br>
Only thing is my mind won't go down<br>
Not without having a piece of my heart<br>
